# azure-app-svc

Spring Boot demo deployed to Azure App Service.

This is a **scaffold**. The build, CI, release, and container machinery are
complete and green; the Azure App Service integration itself is not wired up yet — see
[misc/tasks/scaffold-todo.md](misc/tasks/scaffold-todo.md). The placeholder
`GET /api/v1/helloworld` endpoint stands in until a real one replaces it.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rubensgomes-org/azure-app-svc.git
cd azure-app-svc
```

Export your GitHub Packages credentials first — dependencies, including the
shared version catalog, resolve from a private repository:

```bash
export GITHUB_USER=<your-github-username>
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<a-PAT-with-read:packages>
```

Then run it either way. Both serve on **port 8080**, so run one at a time.

### Option 1 — Gradle

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

No JDK setup required: Gradle downloads the Java 25 Microsoft Build of OpenJDK
toolchain on first build. DevTools is active, so edits to `src/main` restart the
app automatically. Activates the `local` profile.

### Option 2 — Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build -d      # build and start
docker compose logs -f app        # follow the logs
docker compose down               # stop and remove
```

Needs nothing installed but Docker — the image compiles the application in its
own builder stage. Activates the `docker` profile.

### Verify either one

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/helloworld
# {"message":"Hello World!"}

curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
# {"status":"UP"}
```

### Stopping it

**Gradle** — <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the `bootRun` terminal. Shutdown is
graceful, but its logs are discarded and Gradle then prints `BUILD FAILED`. Both
are expected; [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#stopping-the-application) explains why, and
how to watch the shutdown instead.

**Docker** — `docker compose down`. SIGTERM reaches the JVM as PID 1, so the
same graceful shutdown applies.

Credentials are only ever needed at **build** time; see
[BUILD.md](BUILD.md#github-packages-credentials).

## The stack

| Layer      | Choice                                            |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Language   | Java 25 (Microsoft Build of OpenJDK toolchain)    |
| Framework  | Spring Boot 4.1.1 — Web MVC, Actuator, Validation |
| Build      | Gradle 9.7.1, Kotlin DSL                          |
| Versions   | Shared catalog `com.rubensgomes:gradle-catalog`   |
| Testing    | JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ, Spring Test            |
| Coverage   | JaCoCo, enforced at 90% line and branch           |
| Formatting | Spotless — Google Java Format, ktfmt, ktlint      |
| Analysis   | SonarCloud                                        |
| Release    | `net.researchgate.release`                        |
| Publishing | GitHub Packages                                   |
| Container  | Multi-stage Docker build on eclipse-temurin JRE   |
| CI         | GitHub Actions — verify on push, manual release   |

## Versioning

The build uses locked dependency versions. Any catalog change that moves a
library or framework version requires regenerating the lock files:

```bash
./gradlew :app:dependencies --write-locks
```

Locking runs in strict mode — a missing lock file fails the build rather than
quietly resolving whatever is newest. Details in
[BUILD.md](BUILD.md#dependency-locking--reproducible-resolution).

## Common commands

| Command                                     | Purpose                                              |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew bootRun`                         | Run locally on port 8080                             |
| `./gradlew test`                            | Run the suite; coverage report always follows        |
| `./gradlew build`                           | Format check + tests + coverage gate + all artifacts |
| `./gradlew spotlessApply`                   | Reformat sources                                     |
| `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`             | Install to `~/.m2`                                   |
| `./gradlew release`                         | Tag, merge to `release`, bump (prefer the workflow)  |
| `./gradlew :app:dependencies --write-locks` | Regenerate the `:app` dependency lock files          |
| `gh workflow run release.yml`               | Cut a release from CI (manual trigger)               |
| `./gradlew dockerBuild`                     | Build the image (tags version + `local`)             |
| `docker compose up --build -d`              | Build and run the container image                    |
| `docker compose down`                       | Stop and remove the container                        |

```

The single subproject is named `app` so the layout stays valid whatever the
project is called; the published artifact takes its name from the `artifactId`
property instead.
